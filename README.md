## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is my first project for my udacity Nanodegree Data Science. I used the airbnb datasets provided on kaggle.com (see links below) to understand the airbnb market in more detail and to find the influence factors that maximize the revenue. In particular I wanted to answer the following questions: 

1. What is the main factor for high revenue?
2. Which neighborhoods in Boston and Seattle are giving the most revenue?
3. Is it more lucrative to rent out a full apartment/house or individual rooms?
4. How important are the review scores and which one in particular?
5. Which months are yielding the highest revenue in Boston vs. Seattle?

Those questions are all addressed in the jupyter notebook in this repository and in mor detail in my blogpost (see results)

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are two files available here:

- data_prep.py: a commented python library with all the functions used in the jupyter notebook 
- 2021_02_Krause_Blogpost.ipynb: a commented jupyter notebook that produces the graphs for the blogpost. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://snkrause.medium.com/how-to-get-the-most-revenue-from-your-airbnb-property-41a256717226).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

I want to thank airbnb for providing the data for this project. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle links ([Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston), [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).

Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
